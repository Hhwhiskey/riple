    <string name="explanation">Welcome to Riple! Where making a difference is only one Riple away. Start by creating a Drop, the start of every Riple. Then watch your Riple spread as others share and complete your Drop. You can also make an impact by completing and sharing others Drops, just add them to your "Drop" list and complete them as you encounter friends, family and strangers. Remember, the smallest drop can create a Riple!</string>
